I am currently a Postdoc researcher with the [SprintML Lab](https://sprintml.com/) at [CISPA](https://cispa.de/en), working with [Dr. Franziska Boenisch](https://franziska-boenisch.de/) and [Dr. Adam Dziedzic](https://adam-dziedzic.com/). Prior to that, I obtained my PhD degree with the Cybersecurity group at Delft University of Technology under the supervision of [Prof.dr.ir. Inald Lagendijk](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/r.l.lagendijk/), [Dr. Stjepan Picek](https://www.ru.nl/en/people/picek-s) and [Dr. Frans A. Oliehoek](https://www.fransoliehoek.net/wp/). 

Research Interests
======
* Security and Privacy of Machine Learning
* Large Language Models
* Graph Neural Networks

What's New
======
* [2024.11] I gave a talk at Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China.
* [2024.05] I successfully defended my PhD thesis, "Connecting the Dots: Exploring Backdoor Attacks on Graph Neural Networks", on May 13, 2024, at TU Delft.
* [2023.11] I joined the CISPA as a Postdoc from November 15, 2023. I am so happy to work with Franziska and Adam.
